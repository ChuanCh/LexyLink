# LexyLink: Children play a computer game where they learn non-existent sound-sign pairings. 
# The goal is to ensure that the child doesn't rely on prior associations.

# Preparation
# 1. Open the LexyLink folder on the desktop and then open Lexylink (blue icon of canon);
# 2. A login window appears, press enter without filling in anything (you then log in as a
# diagnostician);
# 3. Now there is only a kind of bar with different menus, click on New Subject in the menu
# below exit;
# 4. In the window that now appears, enter the relevant participant number under Name. In addition, enter the gender and date of birth (note! According to the American system, so
# month/day/year). At Code subject enter a capital D;
# 5. Press okay and four windows will appear;
# 6. In the window entitled Define World, click on load and a new window will open.
# 7. In this window, double-click on the top option dia
# 8. Now click on Ok in the Define World window
# 9) Close the programme and the preparation is done.

# Administration of LexyLink
# 1. Open the LexyLink folder on the desktop, then open Lexylink (blue icon of cannon);
# 2. This time, log in using the participant number
# 3. A screen appears with three large yellow buttons;
# 4. Press Uitleg (“explain”) and an automatic instruction follows in picture and sound
# 5. Then press the Speel (“play”) button and a practice field starts in which the child has to shoot empty balloons;
# 6. As soon as all balloons have been shot (or 1 minute has passed), the buttons will reappear;
# 7. Make sure the child puts on the headphones;
# 8. Start the stopwatch and have the child click the Speel (“play”) button; the game now really starts;
# 9. Each time a level is completed or the child goes off, the Speel (play) and menu options appear, let the child click Speel (play) each time;
# 10. Let the child stop playing after 20 minutes have passed;
# 11. You can end the game by quickly pressing escape twice.
