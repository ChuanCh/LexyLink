Open a window, type in the subject name, gender and the date of birth. Each subject will be assigned a number.
Press enter, the window will be refreshed and a new window comes up. Then we can define the configuration of the experiment.
Then we can start the experiment.
The experiment is a game that runs like a "bubble shooter" game. The subject will be asked to shoot the ball to the target. 
The target will be a ball with different alphabets images on it. The gun will be represented as sound of the alphabet. The sound files are saved in a folder named sound.
When three or more bubbles of the same color are adjacent, they pop and disappear, earning the player points. 
The goal is typically to clear all the bubbles from the screen or achieve a high score.
A clock will be shown on the top of the screen. The subject will be asked to shoot the ball to the target before the clock runs out. The clock will be set to 30 seconds. The subject will be asked to shoot the ball to the target as many as possible within 30 seconds.
After the time is up or there is no ball left on the screen, the game will be over.
The score will be saved in a file named "score.txt" in the folder named "data". 
The score will be saved in the format of "subject number, score, date, time".
